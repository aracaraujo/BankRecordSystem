# Overview

I wrote this software with the intent  to learn more about databases. I learned about relation database
in the past, but using GUI solutions like MySQL Workbench. With this software I wanted to learn how to
make my code interact with the database directly. 

This software is a record system of a bank. The software will store in a database clients information.
The software allows clients to be added, updated, or deleted from the bank records. 

The link bellow is a demonstration of the software running.

# Development Environment

The software is written in C++ and uses SQLite for the database. SQLite is a powerful and light solution
for database, so I decided to use since the purpose was for me to learning. I'm very interested in learning
more about C++ and databases since they are very present in the backend of software.

The IDE that I chose was CLion. CLion is a very powerful IDE to write in C/C++. CLion was created by JetBrains
which is one of the leading companies in creating IDE's.

to install SQLite in macOS, Windows, and Linux. Thereâ€™s also a tutorial that helps how to use the queries in
SQLite.
